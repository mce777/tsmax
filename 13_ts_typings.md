As of Typescript 2.0 you can install typings simply via NPM !

for example...

`npm install --save-dev @types/jquery`

we're still using 'definitely typed' Github repo. This is just a simpler way to do it. 
It gets added to `package.json` and the `node_module/@types` folder. 

Another example: for **React**, run this (sets up react and react-dom):

`npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`
